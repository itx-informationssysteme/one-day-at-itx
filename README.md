# How to create an TYPO3 extension
## An extenstion development : We can think about a extenstion like Topic list. With Topic name ,Topic description, published date and status
### Step:1
- Folder structure prepare to develope the structure for the new extension.A unique identifier name similar with the extention name is required. 
- The local dirrectory of Typo3 with local extensions is typo3conf/ext/ we create a folder similar to extenstion key with lower case and underscore.For example: topic_list
- In this folder there are some sub folder for the extenstionClasses, Resources and Public . There is another fileext_emconf.php .We can copy and take this file from a existing extension

### Step:2
- We need to develope a domain model for the extension.
- In Classes/Domain/Model/ we can create a extenstion like topic.php .
- This class should be derived from AbstracEntity.
- Which is at \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\DomainObject\AbstractEntity
- In this class we can add the variable like topic descriotion, topic_date and status.

### Step 3:
- Now we can make Persistent layer configuration. We can genrate instance for the topic with properties
- Now we create a database table necessary for that.
- We can write Create table query at file with column name at the sql file.
- Then we can run the command EXT:topic_list/ext_tables.sql
- In the folder /Configuration/TCA/ a php file is there which  file returns an array with the all information
- THis file has some sections ctrl, basic characteristics are how the table name ,columns is described for each table column .
- If we install it at backend we can see the first outout of the extension(May be first topic)

### Step 4:
- application flow is now required with controller and action method.
- Now at the backend we can access. Then we need to go frontend. Frontend with HTML can be shown is done by the view.
- We make the connection between the model and the view is the controller.
- We can give the name TopicController.

### step 5:
- Now we should add a template.
- Resources/Private/Templates/TopicList/TopicList.html we can place a html template.
- Data is rendered from the table of DB and printed at frontend.

### step 5
- We need to configure the plugin
- Controller action combination is defeined at ext_localconf.php
- With the registration of the plugin, so it should appears in the selection box of the content element Plugin.
- We can do this both with the edit two function configurePlugin() and registerPlugin() function at two different location
- sys folder need to set so that topics can be set at the start pointer of plugin

### Step 6
- Install and test the extension
